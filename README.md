# healthkit_parser

## Introduction

The `healthkit_parser` project provides a Python script to export data from Apple HealthKit XML files (version 13) into tables within a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed
- PostgreSQL installed and running
- Required Python libraries: `psycopg2`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`

## Setup and Configuration

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: If the code is hosted in a Git repository, clone it or download the zip file and extract it to a local directory.

2. **Install Required Libraries**: You may need to install the required Python libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install psycopg2
   ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**: Open the Python script (`extract_data.py`) and modify the following database connection parameters as per your PostgreSQL setup:

   ```python
   host = "localhost"
   port = 5432
   dbname = "postgres"
   user = "YOUR_USERNAME"
   password = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
   ```

4. **Configure XML File Path**: If your Apple HealthKit XML file is located in a different path, modify the following line in the script:

   ```python
   tree = ET.parse('/path/to/your/apple_health.xml')
   ```

5. **Create the Required Tables in PostgreSQL**: (`table.sql`) Before running the script, ensure that the target tables are created in the PostgreSQL database with the appropriate schema.

## Running the Script

Execute the Python script by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python extract_data.py
```

## Additional Notes

- Make sure that the PostgreSQL service is running before executing the script.
- Ensure that the user specified in the database connection has appropriate permissions to insert records into the target tables.
- The provided script assumes specific table structures and may require modification to match your database schema.
